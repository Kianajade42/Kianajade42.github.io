Developers who have used React know how strong of a framework it is because of its flexibility and simplicity to 
improve performance. React is capable of handling DOM updates by grouping efficiently to provide less rendering and more specifically what needs to update and how.

One of the most impressive features to me about React is its ability to behave so efficiently with minimal coding.
 The reusable components can really keep even the most dynamic projects lightweight. To use React in its full entirety making sure you’re working in the most up to date version is the first and most important step. Of course this has been made easy for devs with the simple command of "create-react-app". Even though its tempting to just re-use old code for functionalities you may want to have in new projects it can work against you when trying to use newer react features. 

Another reason I think working in React is so enjoyable is the fact that for the most part we as people think in more "declarative programing" terms. 

when ordering a coffee you easily could say to the barista,

> grab a cup

> place the cup under the coffee spout

> Fill the cup

> add milk and sugar

> hand me the cup of coffee

This isn’t how we tend to think though! 
instead you just say, "Coffee with milk and sugar!"; a simple declarative world! 

React offers a declarative approach which makes  it easy to use. When code is simple, elegant and easy to read it makes it easier to maintain with less to de-bug. Listing all the steps will work, but there is no need to with React, just like a barista, it’s capable of all the steps in between without explicitly specifying.
