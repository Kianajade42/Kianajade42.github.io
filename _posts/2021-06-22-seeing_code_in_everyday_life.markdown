“Once you know some things, you can't unknow them. It's a burden that can never be given away.” -Alice Hoffman

This concept has never felt so true since learning to program. Once you know how things work, you will always see whats going on "behind the scenes".  Being interested in what makes the applications and technology I use in my everyday  life is in no way a burden but very exciting and pushes me to want to expand my knowledge and learn how to create robust tech. 

I find myself always curious about if I could create the functionalities Im using on a website or a mobile app and if I can't think of it right away, I find myself running over potential solutions in my head and pushing myself to figure out how to create it or maybe spending some time searching stack overflow or other dev blogs about how they created something similar.

Even something as mundane as driving from my home to the carwash can challenge my programming knowledge in multiple ways like the code behind...
                        1. The tech in my car
                        2. The stoplights regulating traffic (and a red-light cam I probably triggered)
                        3. Selecting the type of carwash I want on an automated screen when I arrive. 
                        4. promptings on the screens around me telling me when to "stop", "go","place car in park"
                        5. The automated functions in the carwash controlling lights and other various functions

In just 10 minutes out of my day Ive challenged myself to think about many functionalities I would have never previously in life even thought about existing.
