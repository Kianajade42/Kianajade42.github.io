what is it?

Data structure at its most basic concept is just organization and storing information.
However, there are a lot of ways to organize and not everyone prefers to organize the same.
 
 For my personal approach on grasping these concepts early on, I read blogs on how others developed concepts I was trying to accomplish. I quickly learned there was different approaches to storing data in efficient and easy to modify code. 
 
 
 To familiarize myself with different data structures I read different source material and took notes in way that helped me understand and remember basic terms. The best way to learn was to actual "do".  I had a better understanding of effective data structures in one of the first projects at flatiron which was to build a CLI tic-tac-toe game. The curriculum of flatiron was easy to understand and very "user-friendly" for a beginner. However, I was interested in other ways to accomplish organizing different structures. From there going back and forth with refactoring and changing how to store arrays and objects really helped me understand how versatile data structures can be.
