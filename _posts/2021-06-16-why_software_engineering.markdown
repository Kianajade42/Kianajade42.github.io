 why not software engineering... with the world changing and becoming more "tech-based" everyday the opportunity to learn and create seem endless. 
                                                   
																									 - top 3 reasons-
 
    1.Oppurtunity
          From Medtech,security,creating new applications or webpages or really anything that utilizes technology there is an oppurtunity to explore many different areas.  I think about how my career-oriented interests might grow and change within the span of my career and how being a developer has the potential to provide me with the ability to adapt and explore different areas within the feild. 
					
		2. Job security
		        From a tech perspective, the world is not changing. As technology develops there will always be a demand for people who know how to program it all! Even if working for a tech corporation isn't the desire, having the knowledge to create webpages, apps or programs that are desired by entrepreneurs can always be an option. 
						
		3. Somewhere between creatvity and knowledge  
			      Maybe it's where creativity and knowledge meet...From a personal perspective I have always been a strong artist and in academics. When thinking about a career path I always struggled to find a way to keep and develop both of these strengths.  The more I learned about different languages and about the ways different delevopers approach situations I begin to appreciate how much creativity along with a devs knowledge can (literally) make or break what is trying to be accomplished.  From the front-end and back-end the creativity and knowledge needed to bring it all together is an exciting field to find yourself in.
